- Creates a constant mist effect, similar to stage smoke, for dramatic effect
- Runs on USB-C powered ultrasonic atomizer modules that can be switched on and off
- Water from a bottle strapped to the leg drips slowly into the modules through a towel plug
- Water can be dyed (e.g., purple) with food coloring to create themed effects, like a Halloween vibe
